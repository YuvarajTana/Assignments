- What does the following component do?
- Are there any problems with it? If so, what are they?
- Are there any improvements/changes you would make?

# Here is My anwsers 
1. What does the following component do ?
  The Component does creating User Interface of displaying list of items with basic styles. 
  It supports basic funtionality by logging clicked item by attahing click event to list item.

2. Are there any problems with it? If so, what are they?
  Yes, there are couple of issues, which creates a reference errors, performance issues and not a clean code 

3. Are there any improvements/changes you would make?
  Yes, In order to render this component to generate UI for listing items information, the following things are taken cared
  a) The super() needs to be called before this.state to avoid refernce errors 
  b) Need to have uniquie keys on li elements, Its crucial for avoiding needless rerender performance hits
  c) In order to keep your React list components tidy, we can extract them to standalone component that only care about their concerns. 
     For instance, the List component makes sure to map over the array to render a list of ListItem components for each item as child component


# Here is Refactored code
```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ListComponent extends Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.handlClick = this.handlClick.bind(this);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps){
    return nextProps.items !== this.props.items;
  }
  handlClick(item){
    console.log('Clicked Item', item);
  }
  render(){
    const { items } = this.props;
    return(
      <ul>
        { items && items.map( item => <ListItem key={ item.id } item = { item } handlClick = { this.handlClick } /> ) }
      </ul>
    );
  }
}
```

```jsx
class ListItem extends Component{
  render(){
    const { item, handlClick } = this.props
    return (
      <li onClick= {() => {
          handlClick(item)
        }}>
        { item.text }
      </li>
      );
  }
}
export default ListComponent;
```
